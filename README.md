## About the Project
Eruditum is a classical music guide built upon the Open Opus API. This api is a classical music metadata database but I used it on the sense of building a platform that would let the user explore and discover new music, new pieces, new composers. 

This is a project I built during a period of a personal rediscovery of classical music. And the fact that I found the Open Opus API was trully a very interesting coincidence.

In this project I used React.js as the main platform, but also:
 - React Router
 - Framer Motion
 - Styled Components
 - Redux for the state management and the requests

The design and layout were conceived on Figma.
